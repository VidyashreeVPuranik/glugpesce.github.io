This year's Glug was inaugurated on February 27th. The programme started at 12 in the noon with all the crowd gathered. The EC seminar hall was filled with the students eagerly waiting to know more about Glug and its benefits. The IS, CS and EC HoD's who honored the dias of this inaugural function, inspired the students with their few words about how Glug has been working in our college from a long time and how the Glug has played a major role in the technical growth of a lot of students.

The gathering not only had circuit branch students but also non circuit branch students which shows the impact of Glug. To make it even more better, the day even had the Alumni who were active members of Glug and who still feel privileged for being a part of Glug back then.
The MC's then headed on showing a small presentation which had all the previous Glug activities  and introduced the audience with the current Glug co-ordinators.

The most awaited part of hearing the FSMK members wad then took over by Mr. Naveen and Mr. Shijil. This was more of a discussion which let the newbies know about what Glug aimed at and even had a one-to-one conversation with the gathering, clearing all their doubts making it feel more like a family than any organization.
The inaugural was a grand success which ended with the registration of a lot of interested students.
