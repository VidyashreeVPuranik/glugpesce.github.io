Glug-PESCE organised a one day workshop on Phython Programming language on 24th March, 2018 which was a Saturday. The session started with a small introductory at 10am with  the ISE dept HoD, Dr.Minavathi sharing her thoughts.

The resource persons for the day's workshop were <a href="https://twitter.com/hackintoshrao" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Karthik Rao</a>, an AI Consultant and <a href="https://twitter.com/iamabraarsyed" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Abraar Syed</a>, a product engineer, content developer and a corporate trainer with jnaapti. It was indeed a great pleasure to have them as the day's speakers.

The workshop had limited seats for 50 students and it was a great success having all the 50 seats being registered before the last date of registration.

The session started after the small inaugural and the first half went on till 1:30pm with a small refreshment break in middle, with the same enthusiasm and eager from the students. After lunch being provided, the second half went on till 5pm ending up with the students earning enough knowledge on Python basics as well as a few topics outside the box.

It was indeed a great success and with all gratitude to the speakers when students expressed their wish and wanted more such workshops in the coming days.
With all the knowledge gained, students were surprised with few goodies like Python badges and stickers.
The session ended with all the students receiving their certificates.
