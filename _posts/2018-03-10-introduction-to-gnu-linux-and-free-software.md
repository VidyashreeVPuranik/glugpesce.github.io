The session started around 4:15pm as it scheduled at. At beginning of this session we had self introduction of ourselves. First Mohammed Saif from the 3rd year CS took on the session. He spoke about Free software. And the audience response to his session was great.

Later Sanjay from 2nd year CS took over the session. He gave an introduction to the audience about the GNU/LINUX. He kept it simple and he presented in a pretty decent way. And then Varun from 2nd year CS was ready to interact with the audience about the basic commands of GNU/LINUX. It was the hands-on part of the session and the audience were very responsive.

As we had to explain about the basic commands of GNU/LINUX we installed Linux-Mint in the laptops using virtual box. Though we faced some issues here and there our team successfully could debug all the errors that occurred. In some laptops we used Live boot using pendrives. In Total there were around 25 participants. As the session continued speakers were changed, we thought we would not be able to complete the session as planned, but we finally did it. We could complete the session at 6:30pm as we had planned.

We successfully completed our first event after re-framing our GLUG-PESCE.
